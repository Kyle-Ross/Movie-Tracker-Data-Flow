# Movie Tracker Data Flow

This is the Python script which automates the data pulls and transformations that regularly create and update the data for my live Personal Movie Tracker dashboard on Tableau and its associated database. Pulls from the IMDb API, Google sheets, and my purpose built local database.

## About

My name is Kyle Ross, and I've been recording any movies I've watched for the last several years. Long-term, I wanted to run an analysis on my movie watching behaviours as a data analytics project.

This dashboard is a live, interactive analysis of my movie watching behaviours and habits. Through the backend processes I have implemented the datasource is automatically kept up to date with any new movies I watch and the latest data from the IMDb API.

The code I here is what makes the dashboard on Tableau possible and automates the data processing and collection for me. All I have to is add some basic details on a google sheet each time I finish a movie.

Through these dashboards you can get to know me a little better, see what movies I have been watching and see a demonstration of my Tableau, Python & Database skills.
